    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
      I am a Computer Science Engineering undergraduate with a strong interest in
      data science, machine learning, web development. I enjoy
      transforming raw data into meaningful insights and building user‑centric
      applications that solve real‑world problems.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my academic journey, I have worked on multiple end‑to‑end projects
      involving data analysis, predictive modeling, and responsive web interfaces.
      I am comfortable working with C++, Python, SQL, JavaScript, and modern development
      tools, and I constantly seek opportunities to improve my technical depth.
    </p>

    <p>I love problem solving and have solved around 250 + DSA problems in platforms like 
       leetcode, HackerRank, etc...</p>

    <p>
      I have also gained practical industry exposure through my Data Science
      internship at SmartED Innovations, where I analyzed real‑world datasets,
      performed exploratory data analysis, and collaborated with teams to deliver
      actionable insights.
    </p>

    <p>
      My long‑term goal is to grow as a skilled engineer who can design
      scalable systems, apply data‑driven thinking, and contribute to impactful
      technology products.
    </p>
